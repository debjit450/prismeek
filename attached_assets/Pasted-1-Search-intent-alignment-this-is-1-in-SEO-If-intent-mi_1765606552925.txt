1. Search intent alignment (this is #1 in SEO)

If intent mismatches, you will never rank — even with perfect optimization.

You must match:

Informational vs transactional vs navigational

Freshness intent (news vs evergreen)

Format intent (list, guide, comparison, tool, short answer)

Example:

Query: “best laptops under 60k”
Ranking pages = lists + tables
A long essay = dead

Google ranks intent-matching pages, not “best written” pages.

2. Topical authority (SEO’s silent killer feature)

Google doesn’t rank pages in isolation anymore.

You need:

A content cluster

Internal linking between related pages

Clear topical depth

Instead of:

1 article on “React performance”

You need:

React performance

React memoization

useCallback vs useMemo

React re-render causes

React profiling tools

This tells Google: you own this topic.

3. Internal linking (most underused SEO weapon)

Internal links do 3 things:

Pass authority

Define hierarchy

Help discovery

Best practices:

Link from high-traffic pages → important pages

Use descriptive anchor text (not “click here”)

Build hub → spoke structure

A well-linked site with zero backlinks can still rank.

4. Crawlability & index control

If Google can’t crawl or understand your site properly, SEO stops.

You must manage:

Robots.txt (no accidental blocking)

XML sitemaps (clean, updated)

Canonical URLs

No orphan pages

Pagination handling

Also:

Don’t index thin pages

Don’t index filter junk

Don’t index duplicates

Fewer, stronger pages > many weak ones.

5. On-page SEO beyond keywords

Modern on-page SEO is semantic, not keyword stuffing.

You need:

Entities (people, places, brands, concepts)

Related terms (LSI is outdated wording, but concept matters)

Natural language coverage

Google understands:

“Apple” = company, products, CEO, ecosystem

If your page covers the entity graph, rankings jump.

6. Title & SERP optimization (CTR SEO)

Your ranking is influenced by how many people click you.

A good title:

Matches intent

Creates contrast

Sets expectation clearly

Bad:

“Complete Guide to SEO”

Good:

“SEO in 2025: What Actually Ranks After Helpful Content Update”

Meta descriptions don’t rank directly, but CTR does.

7. Core Web Vitals (SEO-only angle)

This is still SEO.

Focus on:

LCP (largest content element)

CLS (layout stability)

INP (interaction latency)

These are ranking tie-breakers, but at scale, they matter.

Especially when:

Content quality is similar

Competition is high

8. Backlinks quality & relevance

SEO reality:

Relevance > DR

Editorial > paid

Fewer strong links > many weak ones

Google evaluates:

Topic relevance

Placement (in-content > footer)

Anchor context

Linking site history

One solid link can beat 50 junk ones.

9. Freshness & update signals

For many queries, updated content outranks better content.

SEO freshness signals:

Updated timestamps

Content changes (not just date change)

New internal links

New sections added

This matters heavily for:

Tech

News

Comparisons

Pricing

“Best” queries

10. Indexation efficiency (advanced SEO)

Google has a crawl budget, even for small sites.

Optimize by:

Removing low-value pages

No-indexing utility pages

Consolidating similar articles

Merging thin content

This pushes crawl attention to important pages.

SEO-only mental model

If you want to rank, ask:

Does this page match search intent?

Is this the best page on my site for this topic?

Is my site the best site for this topic cluster?

Can Google crawl, understand, and trust it easily?

If yes → rankings follow.
